WPF on screen keyboard
Inspired by https://github.com/imasm/wpfkb.

The visual keyboard control is a WPF control derived from Grid.  Attached properties allow child elements of the keyboard to behave as keys of the keyboard.

The WPF Touch Screen Keyboard was the insperation for this control.  I felt the Touch Screen Keyboard's behavour was too tightly coupled to it's display logic.  This prompted me to create the Visual Keyboard control.
